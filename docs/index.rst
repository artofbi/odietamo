Welcome to ODIetAmo documentation!
==================================

Oracle Data Integrator (ODI) is Oracle's premier data integration/ETL tool.
However, like its main competitor, Infomatica, the source code is stored as binary-like formats and
cannot be (easily/at all) extracted out and stored in a modern 
source control tool.

As such the world of modern development processes and practises (DevOps) 
is closed to such tools - unless one can develop software that 
will extract the code and put it into source control.

We do just that.
