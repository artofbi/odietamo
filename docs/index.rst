Welcome to odisvn's documentation!
==================================

ODI is Oracle's premier ETL tool.  However like its main competitor
infomatica, the source code is stored as binary-like formats and
cannot be (easily/at all) extracted out and stored in a modern 
source control tool

As such the world of modern development processes and proactises (DevOps) 
is closed to such tools - unless one can develop software that 
will extract the code and put it into source control.

We do just that.
