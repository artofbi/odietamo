Welcome to the ODI-SCM documentation!
=====================================

Welcome to ODI-SCM.

Oracle Data Integrator (ODI) is Oracle's premier data integration/ETL/ELT tool.

The source code is stored as data in the ODI repository and cannot be (easily) extracted out and stored in a modern source control tool.

As such the world of modern development processes and practises (DevOps) is closed to projects and developers using this tool - unless one can develop software that 
will extract the code and put it into source control.

We do just that.

Welcome to ODI-SCM.
