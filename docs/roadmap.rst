ODI-SCM development roadmap
===========================

So, what's next?

Well, a few off of the tops of our heads:

* Fully document the ODI-SCM commands.
* Less noisy command output!
* Documentation and demonstration of check-in and merge conflict detection and resolution.
* Get through the current enhancements list (tracked as Issues on the GitHub site).
* Deployment of database structures from the SCM system.
* Documentation and demonstration of ODI test automation.
* Documentation and demonstration for the ODI repository continuous rebuild tool.
* Continuous Integration.
* Build FitNesse/DbFit unit and acceptance tests for ODI-SCM.
* Documentation and demonstration of the ODI Scenario decompiler (the tool we use to find lost source code for Scenarios).
* Less *Solution of Frankenstein*, more *single development language* and *single tool installation*.
* Less *Windows only*, more *platform independence*.
* Look ahead to ODI 12c.
* Cloud based Continuous Integration.
* Drop support for the SDK-less ODI 10g and make it all much faster!
