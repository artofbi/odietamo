Notes on documenting the project
--------------------------------

I am using the Python based project `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pococo.org>`_ for creating
decent documentation from text files.  This way we can store the docs, as plain text
in the repo alongside the code it refers to, keeping the docs more uptodate than expected.

There are three levels of sophistication with the Sphinx tool:

1. markdown - just write a narrative

2. markdown with code introspection - narrative interspersed with
   formatted code pulled from current SCM

3. extensions - specific extensions to the sphinx codebase.
