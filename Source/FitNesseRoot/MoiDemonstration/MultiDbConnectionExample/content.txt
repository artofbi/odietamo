This page demonstrates that we can connect to multiple different databases in the same page and set up or destroy test data or in fact run tests!

As usual, set up the Java CLASSPATH...
!path lib/*.jar

!-...and import the DbFit fixture package.-!
|Import fixture|
|dbfit.fixture|

Connect to a SQL Server database:
!|DatabaseEnvironment|SqlServer|
|ConnectUsingFile|DATASERVER_MDM_JDBC.properties|

Run a query:
|Query|select count(*) as CNT from ${MDM_DATA}.CC_XREF|
|CNT|
|3|

Disconnect from the SQL Server database:
!|DatabaseEnvironment|
|Close|

Connect to a Teradata database:
!|DatabaseEnvironment|Teradata|
|ConnectUsingFile|DATASERVER_MOI_JDBC.properties|

Are we still connected to SQL Server too!? Let's run a query to find out:
|Query|select count(*) as CNT from ${MDM_DATA}.TEST_DBFIT|
|CNT|
|3|

Are we connected to Teradata!? We should be.  Let's run a query to find out:
|Query|select count(*) as CNT from ${MOI_A_UKM_MDM_DATA}.cc_xref|
|CNT|
|3|

Disconnect from the Teradata database:
!|DatabaseEnvironment|
|Close|

Are we still connected to SQL Server!? Let's run a query to find out:
|Query|select count(*) as CNT from ${MDM_DATA}.TEST_DBFIT|
|CNT|
|3|
