The first file (C:/temp/threeLines.txt) contains: -

{{{This is the first line.
And, this is the second line.
And, finally, this is the last, aka 3rd, line.}}}

The second file (C:/temp/differingThreeLines.txt) contains: -

{{{This is the first line.
And, this is not the second line as found in the baseline file.
And, finally, this is the last, aka 3rd, line.}}}

Take a look. We can also use it to compare directories too.

This only tells us if the file is different and we'd probably want to ignore any differences in the order of lines too.

Now, if we could just have a fixture that writes the expected output to a file first from a fixture we'd have something usable (apart from line order differences)..

We can use the CommandLine again. It has a CreateFile method!

|CommandLine|
|createFile|C:/temp/myfile.txt|!-This is the first line.
And, this is the second line.
And, finally, this is the last, aka 3rd, line.-!|

|CompareFiles|
|check|file|C:/temp/threeLines.txt|same as|C:/temp/myfile.txt|OK|

What if we put the lines in a different order?

|CommandLine|
|createFile|C:/temp/myOtherFile.txt|!-This is the first line.
And, finally, this is the last, aka 3rd, line.
And, this is the second line.
-!|
